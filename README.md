**Corona Home Quarantine Suggestions - a collection of things to do and know, when you spend your time at home**

There is a lot of information going around social media related to the corona crisis and people staying at home. Many people have to deal with kids, having a hard time keeping them busy and happy. Over the past few days I have been sharing things I have seen on social media with my friends and family. Today I had the idea to start puttimg a collection on github, so it is easier for people to share accross social media channels.

If you have any suggestions or contributions, just let me know...

I added language hints because due to me being in Germany, most of the things are in german.
